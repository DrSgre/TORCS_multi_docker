-- Local no ETCD --
screenpipe = 101% CPU - ~6.0% RAM increasing
IPC_command = 5.3% CPU - ~6.0% RAM increasing
Xorg = 4-6% CPU - 0.5% RAM
Data on executable is too low to be computed. The rendered data, despite being with 2.22 fps, is rendered with a latency of MANY seconds about 5 sec for EACH frame (increasing perceived latency as times goes on).

-- Local original ETCD --
screenpipe = 150% CPU (2 processes) - 0.7% RAM
IPC_command = 105% CPU - 1.2% RAM
ETCD = 25-30% CPU - 30% RAM (increasing with a reduction in performance and fps)
Xorg = 4% CPU - 0.5% RAM
ETCD in a local environment seems to endure quite a bit, probably because the storage is able to handle the increasing size of the ETCD DB with no problems. The data is rendered with about 0.70 fps.

-- Local updated ETCD --
screenpipe = 145% CPU (2 processes) - 0.7% RAM
IPC_command = 105% CPU - 1.4% RAM
ETCD = 15-20% CPU - 30% RAM (increasing with a reduction in performance and fps)
Xorg = 4% CPU - 0.6% RAM
Despite the management of the DB size, the RAM seems to still keep on increasing. The data is rendered with about 0.74 fps.

\chapter{State of the art}
\label{cap:state-of-the-art}
\intro{This chapter discusses the state-of-the-art in relation to the scope this project, with a coverage of multiple topics which consitute the background of our work.}

\section{An overview on Game Engines}
\intro{Discussion on the main features of Game Engines, with an overview of Legacy Game Engines and their shortcomings.}

\section{Distributed Game Engines}
\intro{Discussion of the general design proposals in the context Distributed Game Engines, which are presented as a solution to the shortcomings of Legacy Game Engines.}

\subsection{Proposed architectures}
\intro{Discussion of some proposed distributed architectures for Distributed Game Engines, including: client-server, cloud gaming, computation offloading.}

\subsection{Game responsiveness vs. User tolerance}
\intro{Discussion of the problem of game responsiveness (including network latency) against the tolerance of players to delays and poor performance.}

\subsection{System scalability}
\intro{Discussion of the problem of scalability, which introduces additional traffic (thus network latency) and synchronization issues.}

\section{Synchronization of a shared Game State}
\intro{Discussion about the distribution and synchronization of a shared Game State between multiple Game Engines.}

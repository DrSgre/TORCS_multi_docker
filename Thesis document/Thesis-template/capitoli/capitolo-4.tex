\intro{This chapter discusses the scope of the thesis, with the feasibility study conducted on multiple softwares and introducing the main subject of experimentation, which is the \textbf{TORCS game engine}. \\ \\
	(The main purpose of this whole chapter is to provide the reader with a clear understanding of the reasons behind the choice of TORCS as game engine for our tests.)}
